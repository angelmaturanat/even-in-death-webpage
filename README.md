# Even in Death landing page
This page was created to show links from social networks like "AllMyLinks" or "Linktree" pages, but with the possibility of adjusting styles and requirements of the fan club.

This project was used to learn a bit about ReactJs and Tailwind, it probably needs more work to bring the code up to current code standards.
